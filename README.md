# LB-AS-2D

**LB-AS-2D** *(Low Budget Analog Saw made in 2 Days)* is a simple, VST synthesizer plugin created in two days in the "garbage" style of an analog sound. It simulates the rough sound of a sawtooth wave with a minimalistic set of parameters that allow you to quickly adjust the basic synthesis.
